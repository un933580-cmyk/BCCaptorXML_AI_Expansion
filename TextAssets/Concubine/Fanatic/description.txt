Based on the citations provided and your request, here's a proposed next stage for the "Devoted" skill in the mod:

**Skill Name:** Fanatically Devoted
**Prerequisite:** Devoted (current maximum level)
**Description:**
The hero is now completely consumed by their devotion to their master. Their existence revolves solely around serving and pleasing them, with no room for independent thought or action.

**Effects:**
1. **Absolute Loyalty:** The hero will unquestioningly follow any order from their master, regardless of the moral implications.
2. **Self-Sacrifice:** They are willing to give up everything - possessions, status, even their own life - if they believe it would please their master.
3. **Enhanced Sexual Submission:** Their desire to sexually satisfy their master becomes all-consuming. They will eagerly engage in any sexual act requested of them and experience heightened pleasure from submission.
4. **Violent Devotion:** If their master is threatened, the hero will instinctively attack the aggressor without hesitation or fear for their own safety.
5. **Mind Control Resistance:** They are now completely resistant to any attempts at mind control from sources other than their master.

**New Events:**
1. The hero volunteers for dangerous missions if they know it would make their master proud.
2. They become jealous of anyone receiving more attention from their master and may attempt to sabotage rivals.
3. They experience sexual arousal when witnessing their master's dominance over others.
4. If ordered to commit murder, they will do so without remorse or hesitation.

This stage represents the ultimate level of devotion - a complete merging of identity with the will of the master. The hero has lost all sense of self and exists solely as an extension of their master's desires.

Would you like me to provide specific XML code for implementing this in the mod based on the existing structure?
