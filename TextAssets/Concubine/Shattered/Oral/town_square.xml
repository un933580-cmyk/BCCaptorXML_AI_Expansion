    <Text>{=BCCaptor_Text_OralConcubine1}You sit on a wooden bench in the town square, watching merchants set up their stalls for the day. Your concubine approaches you with that familiar eager glint in her eyes - she's been waiting all morning to serve you again. She kneels before you immediately, pressing her forehead against your knee in submission. "Master... I can't wait any longer," she whimpers, already undoing her breastplate with trembling fingers. The steel armor clatters to the ground as she exposes her small but firm breasts, her nipples hardening from both excitement and the cool morning air.</Text>

    <Text>{=BCCaptor_Text_OralConcubine2}Your concubine wastes no time, eagerly taking your cock between her soft lips as you remain seated on the bench. Passersby glance curiously at the scene - a beautiful warrior woman pleasuring her master in broad daylight - but she doesn't care. Her only thought is serving you properly. "Mmm... Master's cock tastes so good," she moans around your length, her tongue swirling expertly. The way she sucks you so deeply makes it clear this is exactly where she wants to be. She pulls back just enough to gasp for air before diving down again, her fingers gripping your thighs for support.</Text>

    <Text>{=BCCaptor_Text_OralConcubine3}Your concubine's head bobs faster now, her throat relaxing to take you deeper with each stroke. A strand of saliva connects your cock to her lips when she pulls back for air, her mascara running from the tears welling in her eyes. "Please... use this worthless slut's mouth," she begs between desperate slurps. Her hand moves to cup her own breasts while she services you, pinching her nipples hard enough to leave marks. The sound of your cock sliding wetly in and out of her mouth draws more attention from the market crowd, but she doesn't care - she wants everyone to see how thoroughly she's being used.</Text>

    <EventName>BC_event_male_sex_oral_concubine4</EventName>
    <Text>{=BCCaptor_Text_OralConcubine4}With a final deep throat, you unleash your load directly down her greedy throat. Your concubine gulps it all down with eager moans, her eyes rolling back in pleasure at being filled so completely. When she finally pulls off, thick ropes of cum drip from the corners of her mouth and onto her tits. "Thank you, Master," she gasps between breaths, licking her lips clean before scooping up what spilled with her fingers to suck them clean too. She looks up at you adoringly, her face covered in your seed - exactly where she wants to be.</Text>
